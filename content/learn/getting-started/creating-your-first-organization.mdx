At the center of any solution is a single seller organization. These organizations can only be created in the OrderCloud Portal and in the sandbox environment -- assuming you do not already have an agreement with Four51 to provision organizations in the production environment.

Creating your first seller organization is pretty straight forward and can be done from the Dashboard or the Organizations view.

1. Click "NEW ORGANIZATION" to open up the create dialog
2. Choose a name for your organization
3. Optionally set an ID for your organization
4. Click "CREATE ORGANIZATION"

For the purposes of this guide, we chose the Name "Example Organization" and decided to leave the organization ID blank and let the OrderCloud system choose a unique identifier for us. These identifiers must be unique across the entire OrderCloud ecosystem, so letting OrderCloud choose that particular field can avoid running into any conflicts.

## Your New Organization
After you successfully create your first seller organiaztion, you will be brought to its **settings view**. Notice the organization environment is set to sandbox and the API server you will use to interact with it.

Next you will see some basic information about your organization. If you did not set an identifier in the creation dialog, this is where you can see what the system picked for you. You can view and change the name of your organzation, and last but not least, view the owner of the organization - you.

Let's talk about what it means to be an organization **owner**. You are the only user able to **transfer ownership** of your organization to another contributor as well as completely **delete** the seller organization. As the owner, you also have all admin rights and full data access to your organization - giving you total control.

Obviously, you may not want to take on the full responsibility of managing your organization in larger projects, which is why we've provided a finely grained system allowing other Portal users to contribute to your organization in different ways, with varying levels of access.

To keep this excercise simple we will move forward as the organization owner, taking advantage of the full control we have been given in the API Console.
